-- In the previous two logistic regression models, we saw the poour of feature engineering at work in improving our models performance. However, we still may be able to improve our performance by exploring other model types. For classification problems, BigQuery ML also supports the following model types:

-- >> Deep Neural Networks .
-- >> Boosted Decision Trees (XGBoost) .
-- >> AutoML Tables Models .
-- >> Importing Custom TensorFlow Models

-- Though our linear classification (logistic regression) model performed well after feature engineering, it may be too simple of a model to fully capture the relationship between the features and the label. Using the same dataset and labels as we did in Task 6 to create the model ecommerce.classification_model_2, our challenge is to create a XGBoost Classifier.

-- We will use the following options for Boosted_Tree_Classifier:
-- 1. L2_reg = 0.1
-- 2. num_parallel_tree = 8
-- 3. max_tree_depth = 10

-- Our roc_auc has increased by about .02 to around .94!

-- Note : Our exact values will differ due to the randomness involved in the training process.

-- It’s a small change in the roc_auc, but note that since 1 is a perfect roc_auc, it gets more difficult to improve the metric the closer to 1 it gets.

-- This is a great example of how easy it is in BigQuery ML to try out different model types with different options to see how they perform. We were able to use a much more complex model type by only changing one line of SQL.

-- One may reasonably ask “Where did the choices for these options come from?”, and the ansour is experimentation! When we are trying to find the best model type for our problems, then one has to experiment with different sets of options in a process known as hyperparameter tuning.

-- Let’s finish up by generating predictions with our improved model and see how they compare to those we generated before. By using a Boosted tree classifier model, we can observe a slight improvement of 0.2 in our ROC AUC compared to the previous model. The query below will predict which new visitors will come back and make a purchase.

-- The output now shows a classification model that can better predict the probability that a first-time visitor to the Google Merchandise Store will make a purchase in a later visit. By comparing the result above with the previous model shown in Task 6, we can see the confidence the model has in its predictions is more accurate when compared to the logistic_regression model type.
